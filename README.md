# GUI Libraries

There are 5 different versions of the same program (more or less) one in each folder. The libraries include:

- tkinter
- GUIzero
- Pygame
- PyQt
- Toga

You'll need to download and install each of the Python libraries in order to run these (except for tkinter which is
probably already installed).
